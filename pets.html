                <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house she is very quick to run up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you alone with her toys as she begs you to play with her.</p>
                <p>Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch she is quick to find a spot next to you. If you wear a blanket over your legs, you'll find her laying on your legs. She loves to cuddle and loves to be pet so she will always be right up on you.</p>

                Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His
                paws are white and they look like mittens. Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get
                injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes
                crazy and meows to go out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside;
                a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for
                four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.

                <p>After every walk, Oreo will always get the zoomies, or he will want to play fetch. He has a set schedule everyday where he likes to eat early morning around 9am and at night at 7pm.

                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle.  He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him.  He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can 
                    pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy.  He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride."  There is also a lot of rolling.  Lots and lots of rolling. </p>

                <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>

                <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>
                <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human food such as lettuce.</p>
